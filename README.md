# First Project

This is my first practice project built using only HTML and CSS.

## 📄 Description

- Built with **HTML** and **CSS** only.
- The design is currently **not responsive**.
- The goal was to get familiar with basic page structure and styling.
- I know it has some issues, but for a first project, I'm really happy with it!
